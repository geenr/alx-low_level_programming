this project is talking about hash function and table
hash function helps in allocating indexes to keys 
these indexes are vital in the hash table/map as the help identify the specific key
however different keys can have the same index this is due to a collision
in order to handle a collision different strategies can be such as forming a chain which is possible through linked lists
we are going to focus on creating a hash table, deleting,  implementing the djb2 algorithm, using hash functions to get an index, adding elements to a hash table, searching a value associated with a key and printing a hash table
